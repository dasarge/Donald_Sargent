</body>Some Stuff About Donald Sargent</p>
My carreer goals have been to participate in the manufactiuring process of many types of products. As i advanced in my
pursuit of learning about different types of product I became aware of different trnds and needs that would be required
to actually be qualified for this pursuit. Ultimately at this point in time i have chosen to learn to program with the
goal of presenting data visually with real time data. This is something that has not really been possible until the last
few years. At least not on a cost effective base. This is because the data or the programming tools have not been
available
